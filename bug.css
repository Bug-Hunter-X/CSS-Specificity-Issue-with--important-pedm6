The following CSS code snippet exhibits an unusual behavior related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

<div class="parent">
  <span class="child"></span>
</div>
```

The expected behavior might be that the span with class "child" would be green due to the higher specificity of `.parent .child`. However, due to the `!important` declaration in `.child`, the text color becomes red, overriding both the parent's color and the more specific selector.

This issue can be hard to debug because it involves the interplay of specificity, inheritance, and the `!important` rule, which often leads to unexpected cascading styles.
